# VBA-challenge

## Assignment Details
Data Analytics Bootcamp - Challenge Module 2:
This goal of this assignment is to create a VBA script that loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs the following information:
* The ticker symbol
* Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter
* The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter
* The total stock volume of the stock

Once that data is retrieved, it needs to be output to a new table that displays that information. Additional calculations are needed:
* Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume"

Lastly, some conditional formatting needs to be done:
* Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red

## Acknowledgments

* For this challenge module, I went to office hours and got advice from the TAs
  * I also attended a tutoring session for additional debugging
  * I learned how to add breakpoints and step through code one line at a time
* ChatGPT was used for help on retrieving the Max/Min values for the percentages and total volume
  * I initiallty wanted to do it in a seperate For Loop like the other parts of the script, but ChatGPT provided code that I was able to modify and implement in my script
